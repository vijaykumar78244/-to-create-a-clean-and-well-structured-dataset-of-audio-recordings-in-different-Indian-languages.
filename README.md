# -to-create-a-clean-and-well-structured-dataset-of-audio-recordings-in-different-Indian-languages.


Data Sourcing :

Identify and procure audio data from diverse sources such as:
Publicly available online databases.
Open-source datasets.
Crowdsourced audio repositories.
In-house recorded data (if applicable).
Ensure that the dataset covers a variety of Indian languages, dialects, and accents.


Data Validation:

Evaluate the quality and authenticity of the sourced data.
Verify that the audio files are clear and free from significant noise or distortion.
Confirm that the recordings are indeed in the specified Indian languages.
Remove any irrelevant or corrupted audio files.


Data Cleaning :

Preprocess the audio data to make it suitable for machine learning:
Normalize the volume levels.
Segment long audio files into shorter clips if necessary.
Ensure consistent file formats and sampling rates.
Label the data with the corresponding Indian language, dialect, or accent.
Data Labeling and Classification :

Create a structured labeling system for the dataset.
Classify the audio files into appropriate categories based on:
Indian language or dialect.
Gender and age of speakers (if applicable).
Emotion or sentiment conveyed (if applicable).
Ensure that the dataset is well-balanced across categories.
Deliverables:
Your final deliverable should be a well-documented dataset that includes:

Clean and preprocessed audio files.
A dataset description document detailing the sources, validation process, and cleaning steps.
A data labeling schema.
A brief report summarizing your work and any challenges faced during the assignment.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your work will be evaluated based on:

The quality and diversity of the sourced data.
The accuracy of the validation process.
The effectiveness of the data cleaning procedures.
The organization and clarity of the dataset.
